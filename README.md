# Cyclist-Bike-Share-Analysis
 Overview I am a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director of marketing believes the companyâ€™s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. I am tasked to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently.
